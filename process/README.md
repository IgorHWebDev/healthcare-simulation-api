# Hybrid Agile-Waterfall Process Framework

## Overview

This framework implements a hybrid approach combining the best aspects of Agile and Waterfall methodologies, specifically designed for healthcare software development. It ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining development agility.

## Process Flow

### 1. Planning & Requirements (Waterfall Phase)

- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Requirements Specification Document
  - Risk Analysis (FMEA/HAZOP)
  - Design Controls Setup
  - Regulatory Strategy Document

### 2. Architecture & Design (Waterfall Phase)

- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - System Architecture Document
  - Security Architecture (Quantum-Safe)
  - Performance Architecture (M3)
  - Traceability Matrix v1.0

### 3. Iterative Development (Agile Phase)

- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Key Components**:
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Stand-ups
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Continuous Activities**:
  - Code Reviews
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - Documentation Updates

### 4. Verification & Validation (Hybrid Phase)

- **Duration**: Continuous + Milestone-based
- **Activities**:
  - Automated Testing (Continuous)
  - Manual Testing (Sprint-based)
  - Regulatory Documentation (Milestone-based)
  - User Acceptance Testing (Milestone-based)

### 5. Deployment & Release (Waterfall Phase)

- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Key Steps**:
  - Final Validation
  - Regulatory Review
  - Production Deployment
  - Release Documentation

## Integration Points
