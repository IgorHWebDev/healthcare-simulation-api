# Agile Sprint Process in Healthcare Software Development

## Overview
This document outlines the Agile sprint process within our hybrid framework, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations while maintaining development agility.

## Sprint Structure

### 1. Sprint Planning
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team, Regulatory Representative
- **Key Activities**:
  - Review and refine user stories
  - Assess regulatory impact
  - Update risk analysis
  - Define sprint goals
  - Estimate story points

### 2. Daily Activities

#### 2.1 Daily Stand-up
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Format**:
  - What was completed?
  - What's planned for today?
  - Any blockers?
  - Any regulatory concerns?

#### 2.2 Development Activities
- Code development
- Unit testing
- Documentation updates
- Peer reviews
- Continuous integration
- Automated testing

#### 2.3 Regulatory Compliance
- Update design controls
- Risk assessment updates
- Documentation maintenance
- Traceability matrix updates

### 3. Sprint Review
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Key Components**:
  - Demo completed features
  - Verify regulatory compliance
  - Review documentation updates
  - Stakeholder feedback
  - Risk assessment review

### 4. Sprint Retrospective
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Process improvements
  - Regulatory compliance efficiency
  - Team collaboration
  - Technical challenges
