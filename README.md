# Healthcare Software Development Framework (HC-Framework)

A comprehensive framework implementing a Hybrid Agile-Waterfall methodology specifically designed for healthcare software development, ensuring regulatory compliance while maintaining agile flexibility.

## Framework Overview

This framework combines the rigorous documentation and validation requirements of traditional Waterfall methodologies with the flexibility and iterative nature of Agile development, specifically tailored for healthcare software projects.

### Key Features

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in processes for ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 compliance
- **Risk Management**: Integrated FMEA/HAZOP methodologies
- **Quantum-Safe Security**: Architecture patterns for quantum-resistant security measures
- **M3 Optimizations**: Performance optimization guidelines and templates
- **Traceability**: End-to-end requirement-to-validation mapping

## Render API Key Setup

1. Navigate to [Render Dashboard API Keys](https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings#api-keys)
2. Generate a new API key if you haven't already
3. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   RENDER_API_KEY=your_render_api_key_here
   ```
4. Make sure your `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` to keep the key secure

**Note**: Never share or commit your Render API key. The key should only be stored in your local `.env` file or in secure environment variables in your deployment environment.
