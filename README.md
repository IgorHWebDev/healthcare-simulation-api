# Healthcare Software Development Framework (HC-Framework)

A comprehensive framework implementing a Hybrid Agile-Waterfall methodology specifically designed for healthcare software development, ensuring regulatory compliance while maintaining agile flexibility.

## Current System Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Healthcare Simulation API with RapidAPI Integration
- ✅ Patient Simulation with M3 Optimization
- ✅ Clinical Prediction System
- ✅ Quantum-Safe Security Implementation
- ✅ Environment Configuration & Security
- ✅ OpenAPI Documentation
- ✅ Hybrid Agile-Waterfall Process Implementation

### Implemented Endpoints
- `/simulate` - Medical scenario simulation
- `/validate` - Protocol validation
- `/api/v1/healthcare/patients` - Patient management
- `/api/v1/healthcare/analyze/{patient_id}` - Patient analysis and risk assessment

### Security Features
- RapidAPI Key Authentication
- Environment-based Configuration
- Secure API Key Storage
- CORS and Security Headers

## Framework Overview

This framework combines the rigorous documentation and validation requirements of traditional Waterfall methodologies with the flexibility and iterative nature of Agile development, specifically tailored for healthcare software projects.

### Key Features

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in processes for ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 compliance
- **Risk Management**: Integrated FMEA/HAZOP methodologies
- **Quantum-Safe Security**: Architecture patterns for quantum-resistant security measures
- **M3 Optimizations**: Performance optimization for patient simulations and clinical predictions
- **Traceability**: End-to-end requirement-to-validation mapping
- **Clinical Predictions**: Risk assessment and medical recommendations
- **Patient Data Management**: Comprehensive patient data handling with PHI protection

## Recent Updates (January 2025)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the development server: `python app.py`

### API Configuration

1. Get your RapidAPI key from the RapidAPI dashboard
2. Add the key to your `.env` file:
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Configure additional environment variables as needed
