# Changelog

All notable changes to the Healthcare Simulation API will be documented in this file.

## [2025.1.0] - 2025-01-25

### API Endpoint Routing Fixes

#### Attempt 1: Initial Router Configuration
- Changed router prefix in `render_endpoints.py` to remove redundant prefix
- Issue: Endpoints still returning 404 errors
- Root Cause: Double prefixing in router configuration

#### Attempt 2: Main App Router Update
- Updated router configuration in `main.py`
- Added `/api/v1` prefix to main app router
- Issue: Still getting 404 errors
- Root Cause: Prefix conflict between main app and router

#### Attempt 3: Router Prefix Adjustment
- Added `/healthcare` prefix to router in `render_endpoints.py`
- Modified endpoint paths to include healthcare namespace
- Issue: Endpoints not accessible
- Root Cause: Path resolution conflict

#### Attempt 4: Prefix Consolidation
- Removed prefix from `render_endpoints.py`
- Updated `main.py` to include full prefix `/api/v1/healthcare`
- Status: In progress
- Current Issue: Path resolution still not working correctly

### Current Router Configuration State
- Main App (`main.py`):
  ```python
  app.include_router(
      render_router,
      prefix="/api/v1/healthcare",
      tags=["healthcare"]
  )
  ```
- Router (`render_endpoints.py`):
  ```python
  router = APIRouter(
      tags=["healthcare"],
      responses={404: {"description": "Not found"}}
  )
  ```

### Endpoint Status
- Health Check: `/health` - Working
- Create Patient: `/api/v1/patients` - Not Working (404)
- Analyze Patient: `/api/v1/analyze/{patient_id}` - Not Working (404)

### Next Steps
1. Review FastAPI documentation for correct prefix handling
2. Implement comprehensive logging for router path resolution
3. Add debug endpoints to verify path construction
4. Consider implementing OpenAPI documentation for endpoint verification

### Known Issues
1. Path resolution not working correctly for healthcare endpoints
2. Potential conflict between router prefixes
3. API key verification may need adjustment for new paths

### Monitoring and Logging Improvements
1. Added detailed logging for API key verification
2. Enhanced health check endpoint with M3 optimization status
3. Implemented error tracking for failed requests

### Security Updates
1. Updated API key verification middleware
2. Added excluded paths for public endpoints
3. Enhanced error messages for authentication failures

### Performance Optimizations
1. Enabled M3 chip optimizations
2. Configured Metal framework acceleration
3. Implemented connection pooling for database operations

### Testing Strategy
1. Need to implement integration tests for endpoint routing
2. Add path resolution unit tests
3. Create automated endpoint verification suite

This changelog will be continuously updated as we make progress on fixing the endpoint routing issues and implementing other improvements.
