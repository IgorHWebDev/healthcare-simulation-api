# Diagram Update Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the policy for maintaining and updating system diagrams in an efficient manner.

## Update Frequency
1. Diagrams should be updated at the following control points:
   - After major system architecture changes
   - During sprint retrospectives
   - When new components are added
   - After significant security updates

## Resource Optimization
1. Lazy Loading
   - Diagrams are loaded only when they come into view
   - Memory is freed when diagrams are not visible
   - Uses IntersectionObserver for efficient viewport detection

2. Performance Considerations
   - Mermaid diagrams are initialized on-demand
   - Unused diagrams are cleaned up to free memory
   - Optimized CSS and JavaScript loading

3. Version Control
   - Maintain backup versions of diagram files
   - Use semantic versioning for diagram updates
   - Document major changes in CHANGELOG.md

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Use the optimized Mermaid configuration
2. Implement lazy loading for all diagrams
3. Follow the memory management practices
4. Keep diagrams modular and focused

## Maintenance Schedule
1. Weekly: Performance monitoring
2. Monthly: Full diagram review
3. Quarterly: Major updates and optimizations
