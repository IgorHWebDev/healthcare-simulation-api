# Validation Framework

## Overview

This framework defines the verification and validation (V&V) processes for healthcare software development, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements while maintaining agile development practices.

## Validation Strategy

### 1. Continuous Validation

#### Development Phase
- Unit Testing
  - Code coverage requirements
  - Test-driven development
  - Automated test suites

#### Integration Phase
- API Testing
- Component Integration
- System Integration
- Performance Testing

#### Security Validation
- Quantum-Safe Analysis
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Threat Modeling

### 2. Sprint-Based Validation

#### Sprint Activities
- Feature Testing
- Regression Testing
- Documentation Review
- Risk Assessment Updates

#### Sprint Deliverables
- Test Results
- Coverage Reports
- Security Scan Results
- Performance Metrics

### 3. Milestone Validation

#### Design Reviews
- Architecture Review
- Security Review
- Performance Review
- Compliance Review

#### System Validation
- End-to-End Testing
- Load Testing
- Stress Testing
- Recovery Testing

## Verification Methods

### 1. Static Analysis
