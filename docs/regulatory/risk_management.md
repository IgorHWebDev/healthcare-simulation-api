# Risk Management Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the risk management process for healthcare software development, integrating both traditional healthcare risk analysis methods (FMEA/HAZOP) with modern security considerations including quantum-safe requirements.

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Risk Identification

#### Clinical Risks
- Patient Safety
- Data Accuracy
- Clinical Workflow
- Treatment Decisions

#### Technical Risks
- System Performance
- Data Integrity
- System Availability
- Integration Points

#### Security Risks
- Quantum Computing Threats
- Data Breaches
- Authentication/Authorization
- Regulatory Compliance

### 2. Risk Analysis Methods

#### FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
```markdown
| ID | Failure Mode | Effects | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN |
|----|--------------|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----|
| F1 | [Mode] | [Effects] | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | S*O*D |
```

#### HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)
```markdown
| ID | Parameter | Deviation | Causes | Consequences | Safeguards |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| H1 | [Parameter] | [Deviation] | [Causes] | [Consequences] | [Controls] |
```

#### Security Risk Assessment
```markdown
| ID | Threat | Vulnerability | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|----|--------|---------------|---------|------------|------------|
| S1 | [Threat] | [Vulnerability] | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L |
```

### 3. Risk Categories

#### Patient Safety Risks
- Diagnostic Accuracy
- Treatment Planning
- Medication Management
- Clinical Decision Support

#### Data Security Risks
- Data Encryption
- Access Control
- Audit Trails
- Data Integrity

#### System Performance Risks
- Response Time
- System Availability
- Data Processing
- Resource Usage

#### Compliance Risks
- Regulatory Requirements
- Standards Compliance
- Documentation
- Audit Readiness

### 4. Risk Controls

#### Prevention Controls
- Input Validation
- Access Controls
- Error Checking
- Security Measures

#### Detection Controls
- Monitoring Systems
- Audit Logs
- Testing Procedures
- Review Processes

#### Mitigation Controls
- Backup Systems
- Recovery Procedures
- Contingency Plans
- Alternative Workflows
