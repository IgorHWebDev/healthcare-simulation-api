- Regulatory compliance documents
- Design control documents
- Training materials

### 2. Source Code
- Agent implementations
- Service implementations
- Utility scripts
- Test suites

### 3. Configurations
- Docker configurations
- Environment configurations
- CI/CD pipeline settings
- Security configurations
- Infrastructure as Code files

### 4. Database
- Schema definitions
- Reference data
- Configuration data
- Audit logs

### 5. Security Assets
- Public key configurations
- Security policies
- Access control lists
- Audit configurations

### 6. Test Data
- Test configurations
- Test datasets
- Performance test data
- Security test data

### 7. Dependencies
- Package requirements
- Lock files
- Version specifications
- Build configurations

## Backup Schedule

### Automated Backups
- **Full Backup**: Daily at 00:00 UTC
- **Incremental Backup**: Every 4 hours
- **Configuration Backup**: On every change
- **Database Backup**: Every 6 hours

### Retention Policy
- Daily backups: 7 days
- Weekly backups: 4 weeks
- Monthly backups: 12 months
- Annual backups: 7 years (for regulatory compliance)

## Backup Locations

### Primary Storage
- Encrypted cloud storage (AWS S3 or equivalent)
- Geographically distributed
- Versioning enabled
- Access logging enabled

### Secondary Storage
- Local encrypted storage
- Offline backup media
- Geographically separate location

## Security Measures

### Encryption
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Quantum-safe encryption for critical components

### Access Control
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Audit logging of all backup operations

### Compliance
- HIPAA compliant storage
- GDPR compliant processes
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
- ISO 27001 alignment

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Documentation Recovery
```bash
# Restore documentation
tar -xzf iqhis_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
cp -r TIMESTAMP/docs/* ./docs/
```

### 2. Source Code Recovery
```bash
# Restore source code
tar -xzf iqhis_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
cp -r TIMESTAMP/src/* ./
```

### 3. Configuration Recovery
```bash
# Restore configurations
tar -xzf iqhis_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
cp -r TIMESTAMP/config/* ./
```

### 4. Database Recovery
```bash
# Restore database
tar -xzf iqhis_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
# PostgreSQL example:
pg_restore -U postgres -d iqhis TIMESTAMP/database/iqhis.tar
```

## Verification Procedures

### 1. Backup Verification
- Automated integrity checks
- Monthly restore tests
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Annual full system recovery test

### 2. Compliance Verification
- Audit trail verification
- Encryption verification
- Access control verification
- Retention policy compliance check

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. System Failure
1. Stop all services
2. Identify failure point
3. Restore from last known good backup
4. Verify system integrity
5. Resume services

### 2. Security Breach
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Restore from pre-breach backup
3. Apply security patches
4. Verify system integrity
5. Resume operations

### 3. Data Corruption
1. Identify corruption scope
2. Stop affected services
3. Restore from last valid backup
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume services
