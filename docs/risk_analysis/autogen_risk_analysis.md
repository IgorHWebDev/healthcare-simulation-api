# AutoGen Integration Risk Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
This document presents a comprehensive risk analysis for the AutoGen multi-model integration in the IQHIS system, following FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) methodology and aligned with healthcare regulatory requirements.

## 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 2.1 Severity Scale (S)
1. Negligible - No impact on patient care or system operation
2. Minor - Minimal impact, easily recoverable
3. Moderate - Temporary impact, recoverable with intervention
4. Major - Significant impact on patient care or system operation
5. Critical - Severe impact on patient safety or system integrity

### 2.2 Occurrence Scale (O)
1. Remote - Once per year or less
2. Uncommon - Several times per year
3. Occasional - Monthly occurrence
4. Frequent - Weekly occurrence
5. Common - Daily occurrence

### 2.3 Detection Scale (D)
1. Certain - Will always be detected
2. High - Very likely to be detected
3. Moderate - May be detected
4. Low - Unlikely to be detected
5. None - Cannot be detected

### 2.4 Risk Priority Number (RPN)
RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
- Low Risk: RPN < 25
- Medium Risk: 25 ≤ RPN < 50
- High Risk: RPN ≥ 50
